# implementing-linked-list-using-array-in-java
Consider that you are the administrator of a sport club and you are keen to know a team’s chance of entry into a tournament, based on their performance (scores) in previous competitions. The (sport) coach has released historical data about previous teams' scores from two previous competitions (tournaments)
 I Created a LinkedList to store all the teams registered for the tournament. The are appropriate classes and functions used for the tournonment such as 

a. registerTeam:
  i. This method should ask for the team’s details (number, name, regYear,firstScore, secondScore)
  ii. Create the team (create a new instance of the team class)
  iii. Register the team i.e. add team to the LinkedList

b. deregister_Last_team: remove and return the last team from the LinkedList.
c. deregister_Particular_team(teamNumber): should search through the
LinkedList, remove and return the team with the given teamNumber.

d. insertBefore(teamNumber, newTeam): insert or add a newTeam to the list,
before a particular team with the given teamNumber. If the given teamNumber
doesn’t exist add the newTeam to the end of the LinkedList
e. tournamentEntrySize: should return the number of teams registered for the
tournament (competition).

f. Implement a Display() Method: which prints out all the teams in the
LinkedList
